# `SELECT` clause

The `SELECT` statement can be used for selecting and querying data in a
database. Each `SELECT` statement supports selecting from multiple targets,
which can include tables, records, edges, subqueries, parameters, arrays,
objects, and other values.

## Usage

```sql
-- Select all fields from a table
SELECT * FROM person;

-- Select specific fields from a table
SELECT name, address, email FROM person;
```
